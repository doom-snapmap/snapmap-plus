# Architecture

Snapmap+ ships a backend DLL loaded by DOOM and a WebView2 companion DLL. The
backend owns engine integration; the frontend owns presentation and forwards
engine work through their shared interface. The Go installer deploys the pair.

This guide explains component boundaries and contributor constraints. Detailed
backend algorithms and reverse-engineering evidence belong beside their code or
in the snaphak-re findings system.

## Components and entry points

| Component | Responsibility | Start reading |
|---|---|---|
| Backend | Bootstrap, hooks, editor operations and installed-resource access. | `src/backend/dllmain.c` |
| Shared interface | Matched DLL contract, callback bindings and shared queues. | `src/common/snapmap_plus_iface.h` |
| Frontend | Companion window, messages, editor views and preview controls. | [WebView UI](webview-ui.md) |
| Fault shield | Selected engine-fault recovery and local crash evidence. | `src/fault_shield/fault_shield.c` |
| Installer | Verified deployment, migration, update and uninstall. | [Installer README](../installer/README.md) |
| Website services | Community authentication/content and feedback relay. | [Services](services.md), [feedback](feedback.md) |

The backend is an XInput proxy named `XINPUT1_4.dll`. It forwards controller calls
to the system library and initializes the editor integration. The frontend is
`snapmap-plus-ui.dll`. Both are built and deployed together; mixing their versions
can call the wrong interface slot. See [packaging](packaging.md).

## Supported DOOM build

Snapmap+ supports one build of DOOM 2016: the April 2024 update, Steam build
13954591. Its executables are not SteamStub-wrapped and import `XINPUT1_4.dll` by
ordinals 2 and 3; `xinput1_4.def` pins the real System32 `XINPUT1_4.dll` ordinal
set (named and unnamed), with the backend's private exports at 200 and up.

`host_image.c` identifies the host by the SHA-256 of its executable file
(`SH_KNOWN_BUILDS`: the Vulkan and OpenGL executables of build 13954591). Any other
executable, the 2018 build included, is unsupported: the backend logs one line
naming the supported build and the final 2018 release, then only forwards XInput.
Every engine constant is a build 13954591 value: struct and slot offsets in
`engine_build.h`, function RVAs as Vulkan/OpenGL pairs in the signature table, and
global RVAs in the generated globals table. Raw RVAs are applied only on a
recognized executable, for its own renderer, so no address can reach another image.
A feature whose engine offsets are not yet verified for this build stays off and
logs which values it waits for (`SH_PENDING_*` in `engine_build.h`); starting DOOM with
the environment variable `SNAPMAP_PLUS_LIVE_VERIFY=1` runs those features for live verification.

The installer routes by build before downloading anything: it hashes
`DOOMx64vk.exe` and `DOOMx64.exe`, installs the current release on build 13954591,
installs the final 2018 release `v0.2.1-beta.19` (by tag, exactly as that release
installs itself) on the 2018 build, and refuses unrecognized or mixed executables.
See [packaging](packaging.md#supported-build-and-the-final-2018-release).

## Engine resolution and patching

Function signatures identify engine code. Generated anchors derive global
addresses from code references. Vulkan and OpenGL share these portable resolution
paths; field layouts still need explicit verification when porting.

A pattern that matches more than once is not an identification. Where two
functions share a body, the caller must confirm its target by something the
pattern cannot carry: the rawmap branch answer follows the call its candidate
makes and reads the literal that callee names, because the sibling it must not
patch differs only there.

A raw-RVA fallback requires an exact fingerprint of a supported
executable. The hook-tolerant fallback additionally checks the detour and remaining
signature bytes. A filename or a readable address is not sufficient evidence.
Contributor changes to signatures or anchors require the two-image test gate in
[contributing](contributing.md#7-run-the-tests).

The bootstrap scans the whole database once, which takes about five seconds;
later installs reuse those results instead of scanning again. The boot pacing
sites (`boot_pacing.c`) cannot wait for that scan: the engine's resource preload
starts about two seconds after launch. Right after the build check they are
matched at their recorded RVAs only (`sig_match_recorded`), checked byte by byte,
and patched about 0.1 s after process creation. The offline signature tests
prove each of those recorded RVAs is the pattern's only match. A patch that would
land more than three seconds after process creation is not made, because the
preload's threads could then be executing the redirected instructions.

Hook callers prepare a trampoline, publish it as their original callback, then
commit the detour. Preparation does not write the target. Callers own the
lifetime of their original callbacks and any relay memory.
They must preserve those resources until restoration succeeds and no execution
can still use them. Failed rollback remains a recoverable state, not a successful
uninstall. The patch and hook headers define the supported installation and
restoration sequence. Stolen instructions must be complete and independently
executable. The ordinary hook helper performs no relocation; its explicit
`hook_prepare_rip_lea` variant expands one verified 64-bit RIP-relative LEA.
Callers still verify every other stolen instruction. Original target bytes
remain separate from relocated code for commit validation and restoration.

## DLL interface

Map rendering lives in the backend and DOOM's native Settings / Properties
panel, in the Snapmap+ tab. The Unlock View Distance group owns an
Apply/Cancel draft (one toggle) tied to the current editable map. On stores
the versioned string `smp.render.v1` = `4;0` in native map variables, appending
the row after every existing string and leaving `allocCount[4]` untouched; Off
removes the row the way the native list removes an element. String variables
are bound by index, so the row is removed only when every later row is one of
Snapmap+'s own `smp.` settings (those move down one); otherwise it stays as
`4;8192`, which reads as off. The native serializer carries the result through
normal saves without a sidecar. Versions 1 to 4 stored a distance: 8192 and
disabled version 2 read as off, any other distance as on. Deserialization
normalizes the snapshot the editor builds its editable map from: an on value
becomes `4;0` and an off value is removed. Malformed or duplicate metadata
disables the override. Map deserialization clears the previous runtime
selection and reads the loaded map's variables; editor-to-play conversion
refreshes it from the build copy. A locked value copy crosses to rendering at
the blended environment's single maxViewDistance read: off returns the native
read, on returns 200000 (the engine raises the read to at least 256 before
writing r_zfar) and rewrites the view's literal. Before that it reads the
block's native distance and stretches its fog by r = 200000 / native (floored
at 256, never below 1): the `fogstart`, `fogend` and `fogstartdistance`
literals are multiplied by r and `fogscale` and `fogdensity` divided by r,
whatever the blend target and in the editor and Play alike; the renderer packs
them into `fogParms`/`fogParms2` from that block after the blend, and the block
is the view's own per-frame copy, so no declaration changes and nothing needs
restoring. The blend writes r_zfar only when an environment resolves, so
selecting an unlocked map also sets r_zfar to 200000 once through the engine's
forced cvar setter, and the editor's Blueprint far-plane writer (`editor_zoom.c`)
is raised to 200000 for that map, so every r_zfar writer agrees. This applies only to
SnapMap and uses signed bindings in both renderer executables. No WebView
interface change is involved.

The Snapmap+ tab is a third category added to the native Settings / Properties
panel (`settings_tab.c`): the category count, the diamond markers and the
populate dispatch are extended under the panel's own hooks, and groups register
through `sh_settings_tab_register_group` with their own draft, commit and reset
callbacks because native Apply and Reset are not category-scoped. It holds the
Unlock View Distance group and the Unlock Map Bounds group (`map_bounds.c`), whose
`smp.bounds.v1` map variable raises `snapEdit_environmentModuleBounds` and the
camera distance limit for that map up to the 32671-unit ceiling imposed by the
signed-short collision and navigation coordinates, restoring the native 16000
when a stock map loads. Every client re-validates module placement against its
own cvar, so an unlocked map is a Snapmap+-only map. Blueprint zoom-out
(`editor_zoom.c`) raises the orbit camera's dolly and pan height limits to a
client-side multiple of the native height, default 2x. Object Mode entry
(`object_entry.c`) repoints the FPS view's one load of its 18364-unit downward
trace segment at a product float covering the whole coordinate range, so the
entry drop reaches the floor of a Grid Room taller than that segment.

Grid Room resizing is implemented in the existing backend. The native DOOM
Module Properties panel owns its XYZ control. In Blueprint mode, the normal
module selection handler adds the native Module Properties prompt and checks
the engine's X action for the highlighted Grid Room. It selects that placement
and enters the native panel state while retaining the Blueprint camera. Tutorial
restrictions, other module types and selection transitions remain guarded.
The WebView has no resizing control or new interface slot. Dimension-bearing
module names resolve through private native palettes and the existing resource
provider. Newly materialized empty catalogs take the native generic source load
before admission; accepted and stock catalogs are not reloaded. The edit handler
changes one compiled placement and translates its owned caps, doors and frames
through the native copy-on-write entity edit and transform setter. This uses the
live local transform, including after a native cap replacement leaves serialized
definition edit state null. Ordinary placed objects keep their local positions and sizes.
Finite XYZ inputs clamp to the per-axis limits and display the applied dimensions.
The current snapEdit_environmentModuleBounds cvar constrains the selected
placement and every connected neighbor on each edit: only the axes the user
changed move, each as far toward the request as the boundary allows, and an
existing boundary crossing is tolerated but never extended, so a shrink always
applies. Every limited axis is logged with the request, the accepted value and
the limiting coordinate. The built-in probe and ceiling light that the editor
owns follow the room on each edit; the fill lights, which get no editor entity, follow from
the generated room on the next load or Play, through the same policy. Planning
uses temporary spatial views and native bounds helpers before creating
resources. Signed-short
BCM/AAS coordinates impose independent representation limits, including navigation
outsets beyond the shell. Changing the cvar does not change those formats.
Connected module branches translate rigidly to follow the changed doorways. A
conflicting loop or increased bounding-box overlap prevents the connected edit.
The engine recomputes all portal connections before accepting the transaction;
an unexpected change restores the prior transforms and module records. The room
resources are constructed in memory; no map sidecars are required.

Built-in lights are identified from the installed module's original entity
names and inheritance. Native property-tree setters, commit and cached-property
refresh update their position, coverage and distance cutoffs without changing
authored light properties. The modern effective light center follows the roof;
the classic central light follows the room center. Tree ownership uses the
engine's matching destructor and delete calls, with rollback on edit failure.

The resource provider supplies resized AAS for all three stock agent classes.
Door apertures and agent clearance remain fixed. Narrow strips that collapse
at the shrink minimum are removed with their area references, cover membership,
visibility and route chains remapped. Native BuildAAS performs module placement
and assembly, and marked blocking volumes augment the resized base navigation.

Object-mode containment first uses the native query. If its fixed 6000-unit
vertical rays miss an admitted taller variant, a bounded fallback extends both
rays to that room's height. Both native body hits must identify the same valid
module; world bounds alone never authorize placement. Resizing also refreshes
the native per-module placement-display models inside the process heap scope,
including after rollback. Otherwise Object Mode can retain the previous size's
display resources until the camera is re-entered.

The native XYZ inspector shares a context with Grid Offset. Its base reset
clears values but leaves the range list populated. AddVec3 clears the validated
range count before native construction so each inspector rebuilds its own three
ranges. Allocation ownership stays native; the separate door-cap and portal
minimum checks still determine the smallest accepted room dimensions.

The faint green surface display is the game's navigation-class placement
overlay, separate from the custom blocking-volume preview. The held entity's
native navigation type selects one of three installed display models. Objects
without that type do not request a model. The native material uses world-space
grid coordinates and animated brightness, so its apparent intensity can vary
while the model remains visible. The resize path preserves these native rules.

Reload has a separate palette membership probe; it now shares the variant lookup
so saved rooms reach instance conversion. Cold construction can run before editor
activation once the stock palette and native main-thread heap are available.
Portal magnet snapping corrects the selected group's discarded XY offset only
for compatible equal-size portals involving a variant. Explicit attachment scopes
an exact-origin exception to that operation. Add/move/duplicate confirmation
also preserves off-grid origins in maps containing resized rooms, including a
stock neighbor aligned to one. Native dirty marking and remainder cleanup still
run. Native reciprocal connection checks remain exact; the normal frame updater
replaces caps and creates doors/frames when those connections change.
Private palettes retain their two cached collision resources across map teardown;
their native collision builder runs in the same process heap scope as the palette.
Stock palette collision lifetime remains native. A process holds at most 64
distinct size/type variants, avoiding eviction while maps or undo records may
still reference them. Save files contain the dimension-bearing module identity;
players need Snapmap+ to reconstruct its resources. Vanilla loading is unsupported.

The shared object uses an append-only vtable. Its original 77-slot prefix is
retained, with extensions through `+0x350`; the current table occupies `0x358`
bytes. The File menu's rawmap surface is `rawmap_status` (`+0x328`),
`rawmap_configure` (`+0x330`) and `rawmap_load_now` (`+0x338`). The last three
are `navmesh_view` (`+0x340`), `run_on_main` (`+0x348`) and `delete_entities`
(`+0x350`). The backend writes a marker and the table's size into the object's
first reserved cell (`+0x08`); older backends left it zero and had `0x350`
bytes. Check `SH_IFACE_HAS_SLOT` before calling any slot at or past `+0x350`,
so a frontend never reads past an older backend's table.
Static assertions pin the layout. Do not insert, reorder or repurpose
existing slots. Add new capability slots at the end and update both DLLs.

Headers define buffer ownership, return values and thread requirements. Keep
engine pointers inside the backend where possible. Copy values across the
boundary rather than exposing mutable engine storage. An accepted asynchronous
request is distinct from completed engine work.

## Threads and edit results

The WebView host owns its window and browser callbacks. Its worker polls the
backend through a manual think loop at about 30 Hz. UI callbacks stage requests;
the worker drains them and posts result messages. A UI mutex protects its shared
request state, not the engine's objects.

Selection, class/inherit, display-name, source and camera writes from the UI go
through `run_on_main`. The backend runs the call after the next native frame
while the worker waits. A call that has not started when its wait expires is
withdrawn and never runs. A started call borrows the worker's data, so the
worker waits for it to finish; the main thread never waits on the worker.

Navigation and staging maintenance run after a successful native engine
frame on DOOM's verified main thread. Recovery suppresses that pass. The frontend
queue drain does not schedule native maintenance or display engine dialogs.

Console `sh` handlers run on the engine's command-execution thread. Synchronous
apply runs inline only when that thread is positively identified as DOOM's main
thread. A known off-main caller copies its batch into the blocking marshal and
waits for the main-thread command drain. Unknown identity, missing transport and
occupied slots refuse the request; they never authorize an inline fallback.

The marshal withdraws work that has not started when its wait expires. If the
engine has started but has not finished by the deadline, it retains the request
and returns `SH_APPLY_IN_PROGRESS`. Callers must not report that as failure or
submit a duplicate. The asynchronous queue likewise refuses a new batch while
its existing pending batch is occupied.

Class/inherit edits snapshot both original pooled strings before assignment.
Result `1` means every requested assignment succeeded; `0` means refusal or
successful rollback; `-2` means rollback also faulted. Only complete success
permits a dependent source rebuild. SEH contains memory faults; it cannot promise
that every native engine operation can be undone.

Prefab Load/Place stages data and queues the native paste action after checking
editor state and the copy/paste cvar. Queue acceptance does not confirm that the
engine has entered placement mode. The engine consumes that action later.

Entities-list Delete calls `delete_entities` inside `run_on_main`. The backend
applies the gates DOOM's own Delete key passes (object editing active, no grab,
placement or pending action, the map's Delete restriction), makes the native
selection exactly the requested entities, clears a hover on any other entity,
and calls the engine's Delete Selection. The engine checks eligibility,
releases the entities and empties the selection; the "Delete Selection" undo
step and the return to idle follow on later native frames. Until they do, the
selection guard refuses product selection writes and reports `2`. Every refusal
before the action restores the previous selection. Portal doors and frames are
refused before anything changes. The page edits its own selection and announces
success only from the returned status.

## Engine data ownership

Engine allocators inherit the calling thread's heap scope. Objects retained
across Play or map teardown need a persistent scope; allocating them on a
transient scope can leave apparently valid pointers to released storage. Keep
construction, destruction and heap-scope pairing within the backend operation.

The frontend treats returned data according to each slot's explicit ownership
contract. Preview requests are asynchronous and generation-tagged so an old
completion cannot replace a newer selection. Large serialized results use owned,
growable buffers instead of silently truncating fixed arrays.

Asset browsers and prefab previews read declarations and resources from the
player's installed game. The product does not embed DOOM assets. Resource
caches need explicit reader lifetimes; a refresh must not invalidate storage a
reader or native object still uses.

Navigation snapshots and shipped resource reads run on the engine thread.
The snapshot reader takes collision dimensions from each cloned entity's
resolved declaration while the native snapshot is alive. It pairs declarations
with JSON by array position, preserving inherited sizes and duplicate IDs
without adding fields to saved maps. Only copied geometry reaches the bake.
A worker owns copied preview inputs and performs the arithmetic bake, while the
frame installs only a result matching the current geometry revision. The bake
lock precedes the worker handoff lock; the worker never acquires the bake lock.
Published lines remain until their replacement completes, except during a drag
or after an empty or refused snapshot. Sparse box refreshes include unmarked
obstacles and use live uniqueIds; topology changes require a complete snapshot.
Play always takes its own complete snapshot, of the idSnapMapEdit that
SnapMapEditToSnapBuild is converting rather than the editor's map, so hub, map
browser, co-op and direct launches read the map actually being played. The
editor's map stands in only when the converted map cannot be read and the two
place the same modules in the same order (`nav_snapshot.c`). During that
snapshot an unresolved Blocking Box takes its entityDef size for omitted axes.
The worker and session log handle
have process lifetime; DllMain must not wait on them or acquire their locks.

The native Start-menu action in `nav_menu.c` shares the View menu's update
request and completion state. It creates its additional button through the
engine, repairs the SWF binding after timeline rewinds, and uses native busy
and toast widgets with literal text. Completion collects the worker result
independently of preview drawing; the UI does not invoke saving or map validation.

Navigation surfaces and obstacles have separate roles. The bake emits only
exposed box faces meeting each AAS class's floor-slope threshold; ordinary
Block Demons boxes subtract occupied standing space without adding surfaces.
The engine also registers their clip shapes for native AAS obstacle avoidance.
Its separate expanded blocker registration feeds flight navigation. Keep both
native registrations intact for ordinary walls; a vertical wall does not need
a custom walkable shell. Traversals connect valid approach and landing surfaces.

Native route preparation allows 256 outgoing reachabilities per area. A custom
bake refusal concerns that area's route complexity, not the map's entity count.
It must remain distinguishable from a stale preview or a failed local obstacle
query, either of which can occur while the underlying AAS remains loaded.

## Configuration

The backend owns `%LOCALAPPDATA%/snapmap-plus/config.json`, including defaults,
validation, persistence and recovery. UI writes go through the registered config
service. The frontend uses the service's descriptors and values; it does not
maintain a competing settings file.

Initialization validates configuration before dependent subsystems consume it.
Unknown keys are preserved. Invalid input and failed persistence remain visible
through service results. Theme bootstrap may read the existing preference before
the browser is ready, then converges on the backend's published state.

Configuration descriptors in `src/backend/config.c` define available keys and
change behavior. Deleting the file resets preferences at the next startup.
Installer updates and uninstall preserve player configuration.

## Packages

The package system is being rebuilt for the April 2024 DOOM update (Steam build
13954591). This release reads, installs and carries no packages: nothing is loaded
from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\snapmap-plus\overrides\`, no `package-cache` or
`package-staging` folder is created, and a map saved or published with packages by
an earlier release loads as a plain map without them. Folders that earlier
releases left are not touched; you can keep or delete them.

The load path keeps one duty from that system: `map_legacy_payload.c` removes
the retired `smpkg.` string variables before the native parse and logs one line.
The resource provider (`overrides.c`) still serves map navigation, the generated
Grid Room variants, the built-in defaults and the installed originals through
`read_installed_resource`.

## Failure reporting

The fault shield handles selected, understood engine faults. It does not make
arbitrary native calls safe. Expected recoveries, nonterminal notices and fatal
records have different meanings; a captured record alone does not prove survival.

The serialized-entity cleanup guard permits an empty moved handle, as the native
snapshot writer already does. It skips that handle's index write and preserves
the engine's list reduction and removed-entity reset. Startup requires a unique
instruction signature and exact-byte verification on both supported renderers.

Crash formatting produces complete JSON or an empty failure. Capture uses bounded
storage and nonblocking guards so nested faults cannot wait on a faulting thread.
A pending record is published only after its temporary file is written completely.
The frontend reads those records for notices or report prompts; network reporting
is handled separately by the [feedback pipeline](feedback.md).

## Changing a boundary

Keep thread, ownership and failure contracts in the relevant header and verify
the production path with focused tests. Use fault injection for rollback and
publication failures, controlled concurrent readers for snapshot changes, and
both executable images for resolver changes. Build both DLLs and test the affected
workflow in DOOM before shipping. See [contributing](contributing.md).
