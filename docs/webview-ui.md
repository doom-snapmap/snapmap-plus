# WebView2 frontend

`snapmap-plus-ui.dll` hosts the Snapmap+ companion window. Its HTML, CSS and
JavaScript are embedded at build time and rendered by the system WebView2
runtime. The native host owns the window, message bridge and UI thread; engine
operations use the interface in `src/common/snapmap_plus_iface.h`.

## Source layout

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/ui/webview/snapmap_plus_ui_webview.cpp` | Window, WebView2 startup, message bridge, file operations and polling. |
| `src/ui/webview/mockup.html` | Layout, controls, entity and timeline editors, asset browser and browser preview. |
| `src/ui/webview/prefab_viewport.js` | Prefab rendering, mesh transport, framing and orbit controls. |
| `src/ui/webview/prefab_transform.js` | Sparse saved transforms and inherited scale composition. |
| `src/ui/webview/schema_slice.js` | Declaration schema slicing for the property editor. |
| `src/ui/webview/config_message.{h,cpp}` | Bounded extraction of configuration messages. |
| `src/ui/webview/theme_bootstrap.{h,cpp}` | Saved-theme validation and initial document styling. |
| `src/ui/webview/LUCIDE_LICENSE.md` | License for embedded Lucide icons. |
| `src/ui/build.ps1` | SDK retrieval, embedded assets and frontend compilation. |

## Build and preview

From the repository root:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build.ps1
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File package.ps1
installer\snapmap-plus.exe install --local dist
```

Close DOOM before installing. Build both DLLs together to keep their interface
layouts matched. The frontend statically links the WebView2 loader; the runtime
is installed separately. Logs go to
`<DOOM>\snapmap-plus\logs\snapmap-plus-ui.log`.

Open `src/ui/webview/mockup.html` in a browser for sample-data preview. That mode
uses browser storage for preferences and does not call the engine. Production
uses the backend configuration service. See [contributing](contributing.md) for
the build and test requirements.

## Engine interface

The header defines the complete ABI. These are the main entry points:

| Feature | Interface |
|---|---|
| Entity list and state | Count, validity, classname, inherit, display name and serialization slots. |
| Selection | `get_selection` at `+0x150`, `add_to_selection` at `+0x138`, and `clear_selection` at `+0x148`. |
| Camera position | `get_editor_vec3` at `+0x08` and `set_editor_vec3` at `+0x00`. Position lock reapplies saved coordinates. |
| Create prefab | `serialize_selection` at `+0xB0`; the engine requires hovering a selected entity. |
| Load / Place | `apply_edit` at `+0xD0`, kind 2: stage the prefab and request the native paste action. Engine state can force a stage-only fallback, reported by toast. |
| Save Timeline | `apply_sync` at `+0x290`, kind 0, with the target entity ID. |
| Timeline inheritance | The normalization slot at `+0x298`. |
| Persistent settings | `config_get_json` at `+0x2B0` and `config_set_json` at `+0x2B8`. |
| Prefab geometry | Model lookup and request/completion slots at `+0x308` through `+0x320`. |

Prefab files and metadata use the path returned by `resolve_prefab_path`; their
rename, delete and folder operations are native filesystem work. Feedback and
crash submission use a short-lived HTTPS worker in the host and the
[feedback pipeline](feedback.md).

## Threading and polling

WebView callbacks capture pending edits. The host applies them from its UI
think-loop under the loop mutex, then pumps window messages and sleeps about
33 ms. The loop runs on the frontend thread. Engine commands and declaration
commits have a separate main-thread path in the backend.

`apply_sync` preserves a synchronous applied count. An off-main caller normally
waits for `clone_bss_apply` to drain its copied batch on DOOM's main thread.
If main-thread identity or transport is unavailable, the current backend retains
an inline compatibility fallback. This slot does not always execute inline or
always change threads. See [architecture](architecture.md#the-30-hz-manual-think-loop).

Camera polling runs at the loop cadence and posts only changed coordinates.
Entity state and selection are sampled roughly every 330 ms. Timeline scanning
is change-gated. Prefab rendering redraws when scene data, input, theme or
viewport dimensions change.

## Configuration startup

Before navigation, the host reads `theme` and seeds the document's root class.
The window stays hidden until navigation succeeds. The page requests both
Entities settings before applying either, preventing a restored selection mode
from pushing an empty selection into the editor.

Messages use `configGet {key}` and `configSet {key, valueJson}`. Values remain
complete UTF-8 JSON fragments across the bridge. Replies distinguish rejection,
persistence and session-only changes; startup recovery produces one status
message. The page never opens `config.json` itself. Format, ownership and
recovery are described in [persistent configuration](architecture.md#persistent-configuration).

## Limitations

- Committing a declaration does not recreate an already spawned editor entity.
- Revert and text undo cover unsaved edits; there is no general undo for a
  committed engine edit.
- Browser preview verifies page behavior, not engine calls, native window
  behavior or gameplay. Changes to those paths need the corresponding tests.
